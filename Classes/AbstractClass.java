Abstract Class in Java :
     *  In Java, an Abstract class is defined using the keyword "abstract".
     *  An abstract class cannot be instantiated (Object cannot be created).
     *  An abstract class is designed to be extended by another classes or an abstract class.
     *  An abstract class contains both abstract methods (only declaration - no imlementation) and concrete methods(complete implementations).
     An abstract class can have all the following :-
         -----> Abstract methods (methods with a body)
         -----> Concrete methods (methods with implementation)
         -----> Constructors
         -----> Instance Variables
         -----> Static and final methods - not abstract (must be implemented)
  *  In Java, we can achieve partial abstraction using abstract classes.
